Once you have
[Installed the SplashKit Manager](/articles/installation/ubuntu/step-1/)
you can build the SplashKit library from its source.

1. Open up a terminal.

    ![Opening a terminal](images/install-gifs/Ubuntu/open-terminal.gif)

2. Restart the terminal and execute `skm` to test it was successfully installed.

    ```bash
    skm
    ```

    You should see the following messages:

    ```bash
    Splashkit is installed successfully!
    Missing skm command. For help use 'skm help'
    ```

    SplashKit supports a number of languages. Run `skm help` at the terminal to see the different commands you can run.
