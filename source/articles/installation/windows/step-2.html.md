Once you have MSYS2 installed, you can install the SplashKit library:

1. In your MSYS2 Terminal, paste and run the following line

    `bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splashkit/skm/master/install-scripts/skm-install.sh)`.

    This can also be found on the [splashkit](http://www.splashkit.io).
